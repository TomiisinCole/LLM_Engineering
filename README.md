# Mastering Generative AI and LLMs: 8-Week Journey

This repository contains my project implementations from the "Mastering Generative AI and LLMs: An 8-Week Hands-On Journey" course led by Ed Donner. Throughout this course, I'm building practical AI applications while learning about different LLM architectures, techniques, and deployment strategies.

## Course Overview

This hands-on course covers building advanced Generative AI products using cutting-edge models and frameworks. It includes experimenting with over 20 AI models (both frontier and open-source), developing proficiency with platforms like HuggingFace, LangChain, and Gradio, and implementing state-of-the-art techniques such as RAG, QLoRA fine-tuning, and Agents.

## Project Structure

Each week's project is contained in its own directory:

- **Week 1**: [Foundations and First Projects](./week1-project/) - Brochure generator that scrapes and navigates company websites
- **Week 2**: [Data Science Mentor](./week2-ds-mentor/) - AI assistant for data science programming concepts
- **Week 3**: Coming soon - Tool for meeting minutes from audio recordings
- **Week 4**: Coming soon - Python to C++ code converter
- **Week 5**: Coming soon - RAG implementation for company knowledge
- **Week 6**: Coming soon - Fine-tuned Frontier model for price prediction
- **Week 7**: Coming soon - Fine-tuned open-source model competing with Frontier models
- **Week 8**: Coming soon - Autonomous agent system

## Technologies Used

Throughout these projects, I'm working with:

- OpenAI API (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, GPT-3.5-turbo)
- Anthropic API (Claude models)
- HuggingFace Transformers & Hub
- LangChain
- Gradio
- Vector databases
- Fine-tuning techniques
- And many more frameworks and libraries

## Getting Started

Each project directory contains its own README with specific instructions, but generally:

1. Clone this repository
2. Navigate to the project directory of interest
3. Install requirements for that project
4. Set up necessary API keys
5. Run the project
